## Overview
This is a image sharing platform that I'm building using javascript during my free time to get experience working on framworks and libraries used in full-stack development.

  - MongoDB
## What I currently have implemented
### Users not signed in should currently be able to:
  - Sign Up for an account
  - Sign into an existing account
  - View posts but not be able to interact with them
### Signed in users should currently be able to:
  - Add a photo with a URL
  - Add comments to any posts 
  - Delete comments and posts only if they posted them
## What I plan to implement / improve / complete in the future
### In the near future I plan to implement / complete implementation of:
  - User pages
  - Ability for users to add followers and restrict who can see certain posts
  - Ability for users to follow other accounts
  - Ability for users to like posts they can view
### In the farther future I plan to implement / complete implementation of:
  - Ability for users to post additional media types (video / audio urls, files (image, video, doc etc)
  - Google / Facebook sign up and authentication
  - Chat rooms so users can instant message each other (currently learning how to use websockets)
